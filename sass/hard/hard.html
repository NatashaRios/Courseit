              <p class="answer">Nope, no funny bussiness. All it takes to start your account is your email address and a few other pieces of information. We don't even ask for your credit card.</p>

              <h3 class="question">Are there any limits?</h3>
              <p class="answer">The Free Plan has room for five videos and comes with 200 GB of <a class="link-answer" href="#">bandwidth</a> per month. After you've uploaded 5 videos, you can upgrade to a <a class="link-answer" href="#">pain plan</a> for more space. If your videos exceed 200 GB of bandwidth in a given month, they'll stop playing until your bandwidth resets at the start of the next month. Don't worry though, we've found 200 GB of monthly bandwidth is enough for 95% of all users </p>
